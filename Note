create a value component. Import the HttpClientModule in the app.module
we inject the http client in the contructor of the value controller. Normally we use a service for this.
create the equivalent getValues method to get the values from the server using the http get method
then subscribe to the observable which is what is return as well as handle the error if something goes wrong.

Because we want to call the method immediately when the component loads we call it in the ngOnInit(). To see this work
we include the app-value selector in the app.component.html

We need to enable cors from the backend. After which we check the network tab to see our response.

To display the values in the html page we make use of the structural directive *ngFor to loop through it in the value.html

npm i boostrap font-awesome.

We create a nav component to hold everything navigation
Next we create a _services folder to hold all our serviceas. First we create the auth service and import it into provider
of the app.module.ts file
